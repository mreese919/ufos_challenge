# UFOs

## The Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a more interactive and in-depth webpage that contains information on UFO sightings. We built more search filters so that 
the user can look for more specific information based on their needs.


## The Results

Dana can now navigate the information by now just inputting one of the search options. Once the information is placed by pressing enter the table should show the 
matching search critrea. however, if there isn't any matching information to be displayed, a no results forund will appear.

## Summary

This website is a great start but it can be improved. The filter search could be updated to a drop-dowm. This would free up more space on the webpage. The webpage has the potienal to become a website. Cleaning up this page and placing the datatable on its own page. that would clean up the webpage and hide the data so more infomation could be displayed.
